Hermes is a no-code platform that empowers anyone to create powerful AI agents in seconds — just by describing what they want in natural language.

We’re on a mission to democratize AI agent development by eliminating the technical barriers that limit adoption. With Hermes, users don’t need to understand tools, prompts, or APIs. They simply describe their goals, and Hermes intelligently builds the agent — selecting the right tools, enabling data access, and calibrating behavior automatically.

The future of work is agentic. Hermes is making that future accessible to everyone.
